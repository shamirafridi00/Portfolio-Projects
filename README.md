# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning
    - [Estimating the Price of Used Cars](https://github.com/shamirafridi00/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Pak%20Wheels%20Car%20price%20estimator):  A model is to estimate the price of a used car based on features like kilometer driven, engine, feul type,model name and city. Used car data is scraped from Pak wheels and consists of 35,000 cars data.
    - [Brest Cancer Prediction](https://github.com/shamirafridi00/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Breast-Cancer-Predictor):  A model is to pridict that the patient has breast cancer or not. Data is taken from sklearn databases and XGBoost Classifier is used as model.
    - [Digital Number Recognition using Random Forest](https://github.com/shamirafridi00/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Digit_Recog_Random_Forest):  A model is to predict the digital number. Data is taken from sklearn databases.
    - [Email Fraud Detection using Naive Bayes](https://github.com/shamirafridi00/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Email_Fraud_Detection_NaiveBayes/email_fraud_detec_NaiveBayes.ipynb):  A model is to predict that email is ham or spam.
    - [HR Analytics using Logistic Regression](https://github.com/shamirafridi00/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Email_Fraud_Detection_NaiveBayes/email_fraud_detec_NaiveBayes.ipynb):  A model is to predict that whether employee is going to leave the company or not.
 
 - ### Exploratory Data Analysis:
    - [Exploratory Analysis on Pakistan Largest E-commerce Dataset on kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shamirafridi/data-preprocessing-eda-all-answers): EDA is perform on the dataset and tried to answer the questions.
    - [Exploratory analysis on Sales Dataset](https://github.com/shamirafridi00/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Expolatory%20Analysis%20on%2012%20month%20sales/TwelveMonthSalesInsights.ipynb):  EDA is perform on the datast and given answers of the questions.
  
 - ### Neural Networks:
    - [Pneumonia or Normal](https://github.com/shamirafridi00/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Pneumonia%20or%20normal%20-%20neural%20network): Dataset of 6 thousands X-rays is taken from kaggle. CNN model is used for prediction.
    - Demonstration youtube video link is: https://youtu.be/4A5c3Dyw21o
    - [Teleco Customer Churn](https://github.com/shamirafridi00/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Customer%20churn%20prediction/Telco%20Customer%20Churn.ipynb): ANN model is used for setting up this project. The dataset is taken from Kaggle.
